Question 1 of 2

What is true about immediately-invoked function expressions? Select all that apply:

    IIFE's can be used to create private scope

IIFE's are very closely associated with scope and closures

There is an alternative syntax for writing an IIFE

Thanks for completing that!

Immediately-invoked function expressions leverage what you've learned about scope and closures to create private scope!

  return n;
})(2);

2

Thanks for completing that!

This one may have been tricky! The key to this quiz is the result of using the delete operator. The delete operator is actually only effective on an object's properties; it isn't used to directly deallocate resources (i.e., free up memory), and has no effect on variables or names of functions.

As such, the number passed into this immediately-invoked function expression, 2, is returned.
