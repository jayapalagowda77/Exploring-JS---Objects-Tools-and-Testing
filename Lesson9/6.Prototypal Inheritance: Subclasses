Prototypal Inheritance: Subclasses

The Cat() constructor function is invoked using the new operator, which creates the bailey instance (object). Note that the meow() method is defined in the prototype of the bailey object's constructor function. The prototype is just an object, and all objects created by that constructor are secretly linked to the prototype. As such, we can execute bailey.meow() as if it were bailey's own method!


When calling any property on any object, the JavaScript engine will first look for the property in the object itself (i.e., the object's own, non-inherited properties). If the property is not found, JavaScript will then look at the object's prototype. If the property still isn't found in the object's prototype, JavaScript will continue the search up the prototype chain.

Again, inheritance in JavaScript is all about setting up this chain!

Question 1 of 4

Consider the following:

function GuineaPig (name) {
  this.name = name;
  this.isCute = true;
}

const waffle = new GuineaPig('Waffle');

What does waffle.__proto__ refer to?

GuineaPig.prototype



Thanks for completing that!

When the new instance of GuineaPig is created, the special property waffle.__proto__ is set to GuineaPig.prototype. This secret link allows instances of the GuineaPig constructor to access properties of GuineaPig.prototype. Keep in mind that you should never use the __proto__ in any code you write.

Question 3 of 4

Consider the following:

function Parent() {
  // ...
}

function Child() {
  // ...
}

Child.prototype = Object.create(Parent.prototype);

const child = new Child();

The following is then executed:

child instanceof Parent;

What is printed to the console?

--------true





Thanks for completing that!

Object.create() takes in a single object as an argument, and returns a new object. That new object's __proto__ property is set to whatever was originally passed into Object.create().

In this quiz, Parent.prototype was the argument passed into Object.create(). The return value of the expressionObject.create(Parent.prototype);was then set to the value of theChildconstructor'sprototypeproperty. After that, we instantiate a new object:child`.

The expression child instanceof Parent; returns a boolean indicating whether the Parent constructor exists in the child object's prototype chain. Since we know this is true after executing the first expression (i.e., Child.prototype = Object.create(Parent.prototype);), the console outputs true.
