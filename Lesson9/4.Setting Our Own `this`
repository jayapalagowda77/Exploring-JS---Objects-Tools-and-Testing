More Ways to Invoke Functions

We've seen various ways to invoke functions, each with their own implications regarding the value of this. There are yet two more ways to invoke a function: either using the call() or the apply() methods.

Question 4 of 5

What is true about bind()? Select all that apply:

    bind() is a method that is called on a function

    bind() returns a new function that, when called, has this set to the provided object


Thanks for completing that!

Under the hood, bind() returns a new function that can be called like a normal function (e.g., myFunction()), but inside of it, a method will be invoked method-style (e.g., myObject.myMethod()). This has helps us when we see potential scope issues with this when passing callback functions.
